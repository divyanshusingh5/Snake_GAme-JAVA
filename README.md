Introduction
The Snake Game with GUI project is a modern implementation of the popular arcade game, Snake. It aims to provide an interactive and visually appealing gaming experience by leveraging Java's GUI and Swing libraries. The game involves controlling a snake on the screen, guiding it to eat food and grow longer, while avoiding collisions with the boundaries and the snake's own body. With each successful meal, the game becomes more challenging and exciting.

    Random generation of food items on the game screen.
    Score tracking and display of the current score.
    Progressive difficulty as the snake grows longer.
    Intuitive user interface with clear indicators for game over and restart options.
